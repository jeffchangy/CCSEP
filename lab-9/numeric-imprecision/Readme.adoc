= Numeric Imprecision

//tag::abstract[]

Numeric Imprecision happens
when floating-point arithmetic or coercion result into
less accurate number which has significant impact on          
the context of the program.

//end::abstract[]

For example,
`double` is a double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE
754 value and ranges between -(2^53^-1) and 2^53^-1).

Beyond this range, it is not safe to perform operations on the number as the
number will be approximation of the value. 
Furthermore, coercion of numbers that are not prime factor of 2
may result
into less accurate number because of rounding.

This issue can cause logic bypass and often
result in serious impact.

== Lab

=== Task 0

Clone this repository.
Install `docker` and `make` on your system.

. Build the program: `make build`.
. Run it: `make run`.
. Run unit tests: `make test`.
. Run security tests: `make securitytest`.

[NOTE]
--
There are no security tests. You will write them later on.
--

=== Task 1

Review the program code and try to spot the vulnerability.

=== Task 2

The program is vulnerable to Numeric Imprecision.
Perform both run-time and static analysis to trigger and test for this vulnerability.

You can use the test data that has been shown in the slides (Slide number 70).

=== Task 3

Review `test/java/appSpec.java` and see how the tests work.
Your task is to write tests to test for edge cases that can trigger the vulnerability.

You should write the tests `test/java/appSecuritySpec.java` file. Use the comments as a guide, and feel free to write some extra tests if you can think of more edge cases.

[IMPORTANT]
--
The security tests you write should fail. You do not have to patch the program to make the tests pass (and subsequently fix the vulnerability) in this lab.
--

[NOTE]
--
Use the existing test code in `test/java/appSpec.java` as a guide. The libraries required for you are also already imported in `test/java/appSecuritySpec.java`. Google is your friend.

== Lab 10

[IMPORTANT]
--
Make sure you've completed Tasks 1-3 before attempting the remaining tasks!
--

For this lab, you should create a new branch for each task. If you're unfamiliar with how branching works in git, https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging[have a read of this].

=== Task 1

Patch the vulnerability in the program by using your own custom type. You can write a wrapper around a built-in type (such as the BigInteger class for example). If you finish this and still have more time (and are just curious in general), then implement your custom type from scratch without depending on any built-in types (except for the usual ones of course, i.e Strings, integers, longs, etc are all allowed). You will most definitely have to modify your security tests when you write this patch.
